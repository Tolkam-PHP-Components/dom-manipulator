## Documentation

This package is basically a fork of [wa72/htmlpagedom](https://github.com/wasinger/htmlpagedom) and the API is mostly the same. See original package [usage](https://github.com/wasinger/htmlpagedom#usage) for quick start.

The code is rather self-explanatory. Please, read the sources/Docblock if you have any questions.
